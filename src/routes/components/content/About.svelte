<section id="about" class="section-wrapper section-about">
    <p>Hi! I am Alvin Meroy. I have been employed as a web developer for over a decade now. Throughout my career, I have had the opportunity to collaborate with various types of businesses, including a marketing agency, an online school for writers, and a web development team. The majority of the projects I am involved in are implemented using WordPress. This involves either transforming a mockup into a custom WordPress theme or developing an e-commerce solution.</p>

    <p>During my early experiences, I worked with Englund Studio based in Rhode Island and WIDSIX located in Arizona, both being agencies from the United States. At Englund Studio, I primarily focused on projects for small businesses in Rhode Island, whereas at WIDSIX, I created a custom WordPress theme to establish the brand presence of an extreme sport athlete. </p>

    <p>When approaching a project, my methodology typically begins by understanding its purpose and determining the best way to develop and fulfill the requirements. I break down the project into smaller tasks and commence coding from there.</p>
