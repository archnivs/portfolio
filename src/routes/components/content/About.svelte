    <p>Hi! I am Alvin Meroy. I have been working as a web developer for more than 10 years now. Over the years, I've had the pleasure of working with a wide range of businesses, from Marketing agency, an online school for writers to a web development team. Most of the project I am involve with are develop using WordPress, either transform a mockup to a custom WordPress Theme or to an E-commerce.</p>

    <p>The first two agency I work with is Englund Studio from Rhode Island and WIDSIX from Arizona. Both are from USA. In Englund Studio, the usual project that I do are for small businesses residing Rhode Island while in WIDSIX I create a custom WordPress theme for branding an Extreme Sport Athlete. </p>

    <p>My approach in a project usually start of what is the purpose of the project and how I can developed it and meet the requirement. Break it down to a small tasks and start coding from there.</p>
